<!-- Paragraph Tag -->

<h1>Biggest heading -> largest and boldest</h1>
<h2>heading 2</h2>
<h3>heading 3</h3>
<h4>heading 4</h4>
<h5>heading 5</h5>
<h6>smallest heading</h6>

<strong>This strong tag makes the text bold!</strong>

<!-- Semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers -->
<em>This text is emphasized and italicized</em>

<b> and <i> tags have no meaning behind them, they dont change the text its just a visible represenation, we need to remember accessibility -> just use strong and em tags

<!-- END OF PART 4 -->

<!-- ADITIONAL RESOURCES SECTION -->

<!-- SEMANTIC DIFERENCE BETWEEN TAGS AND WHEN TO USE THEM -->

<!-- The <strong> tag is used when we want to indicate the importance, seriousness, or urgency of a word or section of content without changing the meaning of the content itself. -->

<!-- The <em> tag places stress emphasis on a particular piece of content in a way that changes the actual meaning of the content. Whenever we want to emphasize something in our markup with verbal stress, we should use <em> tags. -->

<!-- The <i> tag is used to convey a different mood or voice from the surrounding content. It’s often used with foreign words or idiomatic phrases, technical terms, ship names, thoughts, etc. -->

<!-- The <b> tag draws attentions to word or section of content for utilitarian purposes without conveying extra importance, emphasis, alternate voice or mood, etc.³ It is the least semantic of the HTML tags we’ve discussed in this post, and should only be used when no other tag is more appropriate. -->

<!-- Taking advantage of more semantic HTML options gives your markup meaning to web browsers and screen readers, helps with SEO, makes it easier to read and debug, and provides a better overall experience to your users. -->
