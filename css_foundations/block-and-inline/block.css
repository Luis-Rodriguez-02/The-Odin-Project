  - Learn what divs and spans are

/* 
    BLOCK VS INLINE ELEMENTS
- Elements appear stacked atop each other, each element starting on a new line
- vs inline elements that do not start on a new line, and appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. A clear example is a link or a <a> tag. If you place once of these in the middle of a paragraph of text, the link will bechave like a part of the paragraph. 
- Padding and margin behave differently on inline elements. In general you do not want to try and put extra padding or argin on inline elements

    THE MIDDLE GROUND INLINE BLOCK  
- Inline block elements behave like inline elements but with block style padding and margin. Display: inline-block is useful but in practice flexbow will be used more often if trying to line up a bunch of boxes.

    DIVS AND SPANS
- Unlike other elements we've discussed which give meaning to the context they contain. DIVS and SPANS are just generic boxes that can contain anything.
- DIVS and SPANS can be used as hook elements, for example, we may need to group related elements under one parent to position them on a page.
- DIV is a block-level element by default, it is commonly used as a container to group other elements. DIVS allow us to divide the page into different blocks and style those blocks.

- SPAN is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and inline HTML elements for styling
- Should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.
