    <!-- To create a link in HTML we use the anchor element, using an <a> tag -->
    <!-- We can give it a destination to link to by using the href attribute (hypertext reference) -->
    <!-- HTML attributes gives additional infomration to an HTML element and always goes in the opening tag -->
    <!-- We can cause a link to open in a new tab instead of the current one by using the target attribute. href specifies the destination while target specifies where the linked resource will be opened, if not present it takes on the _self value (current tab), setting it to _blank opens a new tab -->
    <!-- The rel attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document -->
    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened, the noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link or reference to it, it also includes the noopener behavior -->
    <!-- Good practice and reccomended to always to include these noop and noref to prevent phishing, tabnabbing, etc...  -->
    <a
      href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"

    <!-- Absolute links -> links to other pages on the internet, made up of these parts protocol://domain/path -> an absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination -->
    <!-- Relative Links -> links to otehr pages within our on website are called relative links, they do not include the domain name, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link, relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on -->
    <h2>
      <a href="./pages/about.html" target="_self" rel="noreferrer">About</a>
    </h2>
  </body>
  <!-- Appending ./ before a link prevents issues by specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory  -->
  <!-- We can use the relative path as href because about.html is in the same directory as index.html -->
  <!-- We will want to organize our website directories better by only having one index.html file at the root directory and all other html files in their own directory -->

  <!-- Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop). Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html): https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html. -->

  <!-- To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element, it is a self closing element and requires no closing tags -->
  <!-- It embeds images into the page using a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located -->
  <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="dog
  " height="310" width="310"/>

  <!-- Every image must have an alt (alternative text attribute) -->
  <!-- The alt attribute is used to describe an image, it will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded, it s also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users -->
  <!-- Specifying the height and width attributes in image tags also helps the browser, it is a good habit to always specify these attributes. -->
